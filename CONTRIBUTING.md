Any kind of opiniton will be welcomed.  
But please notice that I have a very limited resources for this project.

If you are a active user of https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg, consider making your own vcpkg registry.  
This project allows and welcome the copy-and-paste.

If the work is about `ports/`, `triplets/`, feel free to submit a PR here.  
But consider [vcpkg mainstream](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) first.  
The reason is simple. Most of people are watching there.

If you have a suggestions, submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/luncliff/vcpkg-registry/issues).
