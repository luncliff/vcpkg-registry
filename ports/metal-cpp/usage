    find_path(QuartzCore_INCLUDE_DIR NAMES "QuartzCore/QuartzCore.hpp" REQUIRED)

    target_include_directories(main

        "-framework QuartzCore"
        "-framework Metal"
    )
    target_compile_features(main PRIVATE cxx_std_17)

Then provide compile definitions for one of the source file

    list(APPEND private_implementations
        NS_PRIVATE_IMPLEMENTATION
        CA_PRIVATE_IMPLEMENTATION
        MTL_PRIVATE_IMPLEMENTATION
    )
    set_source_files_properties(main.cpp
    PROPERTIES
        COMPILE_DEFINITIONS "${private_implementations}"
    )
